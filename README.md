# Introduction
JUMPt (JUMP-turnover) software determines the protein turnover rates in metabolically labeled animals using mass spectrometry (MS) data. JUMPt uses a novel differential equation-based mathematical model to determine the reliable and accurate protein turnover rates. The proposed method determines the half-life of individual proteins by fitting the dynamic data of unlabeled free Lys and protein-bound Lys from individual proteins simultaneously.

JUMPt is part of JUMP Software Suite (shortly JUMP), which is an integrative omics data processing and analysis tool, including protein/peptide database creation, database search, identification filtering, quantification, network analysis, proteogenomics and protein turnover analysis.

# Release notes (Version 1.0.0)
In this version 
1. We assume that the overall amount of proteins in mice is unchanged over time as the mice used in this study are adults. 
2. The Lys used in protein synthesis originate from the food intake, with the rest recycled through protein degradation. 
3. Concentration of soluble Lys is conserved; the rate of free Lys absorbed from food is assumed to be equal to the rate excreted. 

# Software Requirements
The program was written in MATLAB language. It should run on every system with MATLAB R2014 and above.

- MATLAB toolbox needed: 

We recommend using MATLAB R2014 (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States) or above version on Linux, Mac or Windows. Our program is mainly using the Global Optimization toolbox other than basic toolboxes.

# Hardware Requirements
The program can be run on either Linux or windows. A memory size of 4GB is an optimum, and higher memory may require depending on size of the data.
The current program has been successfully tested on the following system: 16 GB memory 3.3 GHz CPU processors with 6 cores.

# Installation
Installation of the script is not required. Download all the scripts to any working directory (e.g. /home/usr/JUMPt). IMPORTANT: All the scripts including associated modules (associated with the program), should be placed in the same folder. 

# Input File Preparation
A testing dataset (test_data.xlsx) is available along with the scripts for evaluation purposes. Similar to the testing dataset, the user needs to prepare the input data file with the below information.
1.	SILAC ratio for proteins and free Lys
2.	Free Lys concentration
3.	Lys concentration in individual proteins

In the current version, the absolute concentration of each individual protein was calculated based on the commonly used APEX method based on theoretical peptide identification probability and MS/MS spectral counts in a deep brain proteome dataset covering more than 14,000 unique mouse proteins. Each protein-bound Lys concentration was then calculated according to the APEX output, Lys residue number in each protein, and the total measured protein-bound Lys concentration (i.e. 41300 microM). A list of 14000 brain proteins and their concentrations can be found in the file "Brain_proteinConcentrations.xlsx".  

# Run JUMPt program (Demo data set)
JUMPt requires a parameter file (JUMPt.parms). The user needed to specify the input and output file names (along with the exact path) and total Lys concentration in the parameter file. Once the parameter file is ready, run "PT_main.m" in MATLAB.
Non-linear fitting of proteins and Lys data using ODE is computationally expensive, especially when the protein data is huge (e.g. > 1000 proteins).  To reduce the computational complexity, we divide the data into sets of 100 proteins. The program performs multistep optimization for each set to find the optimal degradation rates (turnover rates or Half-lives). 
The final output with protein half-lives and their confidence intervals were saved in the output file mentioned in the params file. One can use these results to understand the turnover rate of the protein of interest.
